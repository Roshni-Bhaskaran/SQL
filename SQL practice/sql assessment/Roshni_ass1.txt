1.DBMS:
Dbms will store data in files 
Dbms will not have any relations
RDBMS: 
Rdbms will store the data in tables 
Rdbms will have relation between the tables
Rdbms has ACID property

3.we can use count keyword to find the duplicates
select count(id) from emp


4.we can use distinct keywork to eliminate duplicates
select distinct col_name from table_name;

5.select * from (select first_name, salary from emp order by salary desc) where rownum <= 10;

9.Both delete and truncate will removes the data in the tables but delete can be rolledback and we can use where condition
 delete from table_name where condition;
 Truncate table table_name;

11.Primary key is used to identify data uniquely and it cannot be null
   Foreign key maintain relationship between two tables primary key of one table will be the foregin key of another table

12.
Where- where clause is used to filter data with a condition 
group by- group by is used to group a row with same data into a summary row
order by -order by is used to order a result data. default order is ascending and need to use desc keyword for dec=scending order
having -having clause is used when we use aggregate function

13.select id,name from emp where id =(select id from emp group by dept having sal>avg(sal))

15.group by is faster.

16.insert into table2 select * from table1;
